    title: I Am a Child of God
    song_number: 2
    verses:
      - - I am a child of God,
        - And he has sent me here,
        - Has given me an earthly home
        - With parents kind and dear.
      - - I am a child of God,
        - And so my needs are great;
        - Help me to understand his words
        - Before it grows too late.
      - - I am a child of God.
        - Rich blessings are in store;
        - If I but learn to do his will,
        - I’ll live with him once more.
      - - I am a child of God.
        - His promises are sure;
        - Celestial glory shall be mine
        - If I can but endure.
