    season: Good Mood Food with Jason Wrobel
    summary: 'For Day 1 of the course, Jason discusses how nutrients in food can directly affect your neurons and neurotransmitter function. He also shares why gut health is absolutely crucial for brain health and how to make super creamy and delicious dairy-free Coconut Yogurt. PS: This course introduces many new ingredients and chemical names that would score you a lot of points in Scrabble. If you want to see those terms on screen as you watch, turn on Closed Captions (the little CC button in the lower-right corner of the video player).'
