    season: Simple Self-Care with Colleen Saidman Yee
    summary: 'When we experience stressful events, we don’t always process them in an appropriate way. As a result, we carry this tension with us on our day to day lives, which affects how we show up to the world. We can only give to others when we give adequate care to ourselves. In this course, we’ll be using modalities such as yoga poses, restorative poses, meditation, breathwork and even some hands-on healing to address issues that many of us deal with on a day-to-day basis including loneliness, fear, insomnia, stress, and anxiety. It really does start with you. Are you ready to put yourself first? WHAT YOU NEED: We have compiled a list of essential oils (plus substitutes) that Colleen will be mentioning in the course. If you don’t have the oil or a substitute, don’t worry—you’ll still get a lot out of each lesson. In terms of props, make sure you have a yoga mat, bolster or pillow, yoga blocks or thick books (you can tape several together to make a block), a chair, and cotton pads or paper towel for the essential oils.'
