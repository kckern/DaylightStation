    title: 'Day 1: The Science of Reality'
    show: Commune
    season: The Nature of Reality with Deepak Chopra
    summary: What is real? How do we know it’s real, and how does that deeper understanding of reality help us fulfill our dreams, desires, and intentions? So let’s go for it. The dictionary definition of reality says simply enough, “Existence is real.” A rock exists. Rainbows exist. That which you call your body-mind exists. You experience these phenomena all the time. Now, if you go and ask a scientist what a rock, for example, is made of, all schools of science will say that matter is made of molecules, which are made of particles, which are made of energy, which has information in it. And as we go down this rabbit hole, what we end up with is what scientists today refer to as the quantum vacuum. The quantum vacuum is not something you can experience. It is an emptiness. It is a void. It exists as the potential for information and energy, which ultimately becomes everything physical. As we go beyond the appearance of molecules, we enter the subatomic cloud, and when we go beyond the subatomic cloud, we end up with... nothing. The essential nature of the physical world is that it’s not physical. The essential nature of the material world is that it’s not material. As Rumi says, “We come spinning out of nothingness scattering stars like dust.”
