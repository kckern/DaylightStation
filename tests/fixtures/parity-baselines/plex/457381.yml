    title: Angry People in Nazareth
    show: Scripture Stories
    season: Season 2
    summary: Jesus went to Nazareth, the city where He had grown up. Jesus went to a synagogue, a building where Jews go to church. He stood up and read from the scriptures. He read the words of the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah had said that the Savior would come to earth and help all people. When Jesus closed the scriptures and sat down, the people all looked at Him. Jesus said that Isaiah’s words were about Him—that He was the Savior. The people were amazed at His words. They said, “Is not this Joseph’s son?” They did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. The Savior knew what they were thinking. They wanted Him to perform a miracle. But Jesus told them that He would not do miracles for them because they did not have faith in Him. This made the people angry. They took Jesus to the top of a hill and wanted to throw Him off it. Jesus escaped from them and went to another city.
