    title: Jesus Chooses His Apostles
    show: Scripture Stories
    season: Season 2
    summary: One day Jesus taught people from a boat on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. The boat belonged to a man named Peter. Peter and his friends had fished all night without catching any fish. After Jesus finished teaching, He told Peter to take the boat into deep water. Then He told Peter and his friends to put their fishing nets into the water. They caught so many fish that their nets began to break. Peter called to his friends in another boat to come and help. The fish filled both boats so full that they began to sink. Peter and his friends were amazed. They knew that Jesus Christ had made this happen. Peter knelt by the Savior’s feet. He said that he was not worthy to be near Jesus. Jesus told Peter not to be afraid. Two of Peter’s friends, James and John, were brothers. Jesus told Peter, James, and John to follow Him and become “fishers of men.” The men left everything they had and went with Jesus. The Savior also asked other men to follow Him. Jesus chose twelve Apostles to lead His Church. He prayed all night so that He could choose the right men. The next morning He chose and ordained twelve men, giving them the priesthood and the authority to be Apostles. The Apostles traveled to many cities. They taught the gospel and healed people. They returned to tell Jesus what they had done.
