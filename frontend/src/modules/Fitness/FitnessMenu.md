# Requriements for fitnessMenu

## Overview
The `FitnessMenu` module is designed to provide a user interface for selecting and managing fitness-related content from the fitness Plex Library.  Each Show represents a program.  Programs may have 1 or more seasons, usually organized by the structure of the program.  Sometimes the main program is season 1, season 2 is the bonus workouts, and Specials is the introduction, meet the coach video, or other supplemental content like warm-ups and cool-downs.

The top menu should have 3 main divisions:
1. ** Next Up**: This section displays the next upcoming workout in the user's schedule.
2. ** Discover**: This section is a curated list of fitness programs based on ratings and user preferences.
3. ** Library**: This section allows users to browse all available fitness programs, including those not in their schedule or recommended list.
