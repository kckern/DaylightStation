# Content Filter

**Status:** Implemented core model and API; player integration and authoring remain in progress.

## Purpose

The content-filter subsystem applies optional, client-side filtering to owned video. A
title can have cues that are skipped, muted, bleeped, blurred, or shown with an overlay.
The video file is never rewritten or transcoded.

The canonical internal representation is a YAML **filter EDL** (edit-decision list),
keyed by the Plex rating key. External sources such as VidAngel, MCF/WebVTT, Whisper,
SRT word lists, and VideoSkip `.skp` files are producers of this representation; the
player is its consumer.

## Three-layer model

Filtering is resolved in three layers, in this order:

1. **Base EDL** — observations about what occurs and when. It is vendor-neutral and
   does not force a presentation choice.
2. **Profile** — household policy mapping categories to effects and presentation
   parameters (for example, profanity → mute, graphic violence → skip).
3. **Override** — title-specific changes: synchronization, disabled cues, added cues,
   blur rectangles, and explanatory cards.

This keeps regenerated imports from overwriting household policy or manual corrections.
Overrides bind to cue IDs and categories rather than to a particular import file.

## Base EDL format

EDLs live at `media/content-filter/edl/{ratingKey}.edl.yml`.

```yaml
contentId: plex:370578
precision: ms            # ms | second-approx | srt-line
source: vidangel         # vidangel | mcf | whisper | srt | manual
cues:
  - id: va123
    category: language/profanity/fuck
    channel: audio        # audio | video | both
    severity: medium      # low | medium | high
    in: 168.20            # seconds; numeric, may be fractional
    out: 168.55
    label: f-word
    suggestedType: mute   # hint only; profile may override it
```

Required practical invariants:

- `contentId` identifies the media item (`plex:{ratingKey}`).
- Every cue has a stable `id`, category, channel, severity, and numeric `in`/`out`.
- `out` is later than `in`; cues are sorted by start time when resolved.
- `precision` records timing confidence. Approximate cues receive effect-specific
  safety widening; millisecond cues do not.
- `suggestedType` is a source hint, not household policy.

## Profiles

Profiles live at `household/content-filter/profiles/{profileName}.yml`. They map the
hierarchical category path to an effect. Longest-prefix matching applies, so a rule for
`language/profanity` covers `language/profanity/fuck` unless a more-specific rule exists.

```yaml
categories:
  language/profanity: { effect: mute }
  violence/graphic: { effect: skip }
  sex_nudity: { effect: skip }
  violence/non_graphic: { effect: off }
treatments:
  mute: { padLeadMs: 200, padTrailMs: 150 }
theme:
  barColor: "#000"
```

`action` is accepted as a legacy alias for `effect`. An unmapped category is not
filtered when a profile contains category rules.

## Per-title overrides

Overrides live at `household/content-filter/overrides/{ratingKey}.yml`.

```yaml
sync: { scale: 1.0, offsetSec: 1.25 }
cueOverrides:
  va123: { disabled: true }
addCues:
  - { id: manual-1, category: sex_nudity, channel: video, in: 4512, out: 4518 }
cards:
  - { after: va456, text: "Skipped a long torture scene." }
```

Override effect/time values take precedence over the base cue. Manual `addCues` are
already in local playback time and are not globally synchronized. Per-cue precise times
also bypass global synchronization.

## Resolution and effects

`frontend/src/lib/Player/contentFilter.js` resolves the three layers into flat,
effective cues. Precedence is:

`cue override` → `cue effect` → `profile rule` → `cue type` fallback.

The effect registry currently supports transport skips, audio mute/bleep/duck, and
overlay effects including blur, censor bars, pixelation, full blur, and title cards.
Timing pads protect against playback-driver granularity and source drift. Approximate
mute cues are widened more than skips because a narrow window can leak a spoken word.

## Persistence and API

`FilesystemContentFilterRepository` owns the YAML layout and reads fail-soft: missing or
malformed files return `null` and emit a structured warning.

The API is:

```text
GET /api/v1/content-filter/{ratingKey}?profile=family
→ { edl, profile, override }
```

If no EDL exists, the endpoint returns `404` with `no filter data`. The application port
is defined by `backend/src/3_applications/content-filter/ports/IContentFilterRepository.mjs`;
the filesystem adapter is replaceable without changing the use case.

## Import sources and synchronization

- **VidAngel:** broad coverage, but integer-second timings can drift by several seconds;
  use `precision: second-approx` and validate against the local file.
- **MCF/WebVTT:** sparser but millisecond-oriented and suitable for round-trip import/export.
- **Whisper:** can align approximate speech cues to word-level timing.
- **VideoSkip `.skp`:** custom external format; convert it to the base EDL rather than
  making `.skp` canonical.

Always retain the source and precision metadata. A cue set must be checked against the
actual media release before being enabled, especially when the source is marked unsynced.

## QA and current limitations

The resolver and player behavior have unit tests. Debug mode (`?filter=1&filter-debug=1`)
is intended to scrub cue-by-cue and verify arm/fire timing.

The remaining work is primarily player wiring, default profile/SFX assets, letterbox-
precise blur placement, Whisper refinement, and an admin authoring interface. Coverage
and correctness are therefore data-quality concerns, not guarantees of the file format.
