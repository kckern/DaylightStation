## The Book Metaphor Breakdown

### 1. Pages (The Recent Tier)

* **Timeframe:** Last 2-4weeks.
* **The Vibe:** High detail, granular, and flexible.
* **UX Function:** This is where the "writing" happens. Much like a physical page, it’s where you can scribble, erase, and edit. You’re looking at daily entries, individual photos, and specific timestamps.
* **Key Action:** *Editing/Refining.*

### 2. Chapters (The Mid-term Tier)

* **Timeframe:** Last 12 months.
* **The Vibe:** Narrative and thematic.
* **UX Function:** The app should start grouping "Pages" into logical "Chapters" (e.g., "The Summer Trip," "Training for the Marathon," or "Q3 at Work"). It’s less about what happened at 2:00 PM on a Tuesday and more about the "arc" of that month or season.
* **Key Action:** *Connecting/Reviewing.*


### 3. Volumes (The Long-term Tier)

* **Timeframe:** Life phases (e.g., college, high school, career transitions).
* **The Vibe:** Monumental and transformative.
* **UX Function:** This is the bird's-eye view. Each major life phase is a "Volume." In this UX, the detail is stripped away in favor of "High-Water Marks"—the defining experiences, major milestones, and fundamental shifts that characterize each era of your life.
* **Key Action:** *Reflecting/Legacy.*


### 4. Codex (The Lifetime Tier)

* **Timeframe:** Entire life.
* **The Vibe:** Definitive and archetypal.
* **UX Function:** The complete life narrative. A distilled essence of who you are—the defining themes, core values, and essential story arcs that span your entire existence. This is read-only legacy material.
* **Key Action:** *Integration/Legacy.*

### Comparison of User Experience

| Tier | UX Metaphor | Visual Density | Editability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pages** | **Micro-view** | High (Every detail) | Fully Editable |
| **Chapters** | **Mezzo-view** | Medium (Thematic) | Suggested/Curation |
| **Volumes** | **Macro-view** | Low (Big Picture) | Locked/Read-only |

### Why this works for Lifelogging

This hierarchy subtly nudges the user to move from **reacting** (Pages) to **understanding** (Chapters) to **remembering** (Volumes). It solves the "infinite scroll" problem of most apps by giving the data a beginning, middle, and end.
