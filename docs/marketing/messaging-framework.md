# Daylight Station Messaging Framework

> Core positioning and taglines for all communications

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## Hero Messaging

### Primary Tagline

> **Where your apps finally meet.**

Five words. Does everything:
- Positions Daylight Station as a **place**, not a tool
- "Finally" carries emotional weight—relief, long overdue
- "Meet" implies collaboration, not just display
- Universal—everyone has apps that don't talk to each other

### Supporting Line

> **Alone, they're apps. At Daylight Station, they're a life.**

The contrast:
- "Alone" = current state, fragmented, meaningless in isolation
- "Together" = synthesis, context, meaning
- "A life" = the profound outcome of connecting trivial inputs

### Descriptor

> A self-hosted data refinery for an intentional life.

Use when the tagline needs context or for SEO/longer formats.

## Core Insight

- Strava knows your runs
- Withings knows your weight
- Plex knows your movies
- Google knows your calendar
- Home Assistant knows your home

They've never been in the same room. Daylight Station is that room.
