## Hero Messaging

### Taxonomy

| Element | Content | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Title** | Daylight Station | Product name, always first |
| **Tagline** | Where your apps finally meet. | Primary hook, use everywhere |
| **Description** | A self-hosted data refinery for an intentional life. | One-line explanation |
| **Sales Copy** | Your calendar lives in Google. Your runs live in Strava... | Expanded narrative |

### Tagline

> **Where your apps finally meet.**

Five words. Does everything:
- Positions Daylight Station as a **place**, not a tool
- "Finally" carries emotional weight—relief, long overdue
- "Meet" implies collaboration, not just display
- Universal—everyone has apps that don't talk to each other

### Description

> **A self-hosted data refinery for an intentional life.**

The functional explanation. Use after the tagline or standalone for SEO/technical contexts.

### Sales Copy (One Paragraph)

> Your calendar lives in Google. Your runs live in Strava. Your photos live in Immich. Your comics live in Komga. Your media lives in Plex. Your home lives in Home Assistant. They've never been in the same room—until now. Daylight Station is where your scattered digital life finally comes together. Self-hosted and fully yours, it connects to your other self-hosted services and pulls from cloud APIs, refines the noise into signal, and delivers context-aware experiences exactly when and where you need them. No middleman. No algorithms optimizing for someone else's engagement metrics. Just your data, working for you.

### Supporting Line (Optional)

> **Alone, they're apps. At Daylight Station, they're a life.**

Use for emphasis or as a closing statement. The contrast:
- "Alone" = current state, fragmented, meaningless in isolation
- "At Daylight Station" = the place where synthesis happens
- "A life" = the profound outcome of connecting trivial inputs

| Displays your data | Delivers context |
| Connects to services | Where services meet |
| Dashboard | Tap, kiosk, touchpoint |
| Check your stats | See what matters |
| Aggregates | Synthesizes, refines |
| Another app | A place |
